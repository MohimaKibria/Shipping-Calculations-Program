# Shipping-Calculations-Program
This code calculates the shipping cost for online shoppers in the US, Australia, Canada, and Turkey. Shipping costs are calculated by asking users if the item ordered is fragile, how much the item cost, and where it will ship to. The shipping cost is calculated according to the location, price, and whether or not the item is fragile.
